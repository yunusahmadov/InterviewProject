# InterviewProject
I often watch interviews for front-end developer positions of various levels. And I always write down questions, but I often lose the files in which I write down, so I decided to create this site.Html questions are now available in Russian and English
.In future updates i'll add Redux  to control language on all pages ,and Azerbaijani language
